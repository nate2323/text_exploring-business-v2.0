These are all tools for telling people about your product and persuading potential customers, whether consumers or organizational users, to buy it. Before deciding on an appropriate promotional strategy, you should consider a few questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_l02">
        <li>What’s the main purpose of the promotion? Am I simply trying to make people aware of my product, or am I trying to get people to buy it right now? Am I trying to develop long-term customers? Am I trying to connect with my current customers? Am I trying to promote my company’s image?</li>
        <li>What’s my target market? What’s the best way to reach it?</li>
        <li>Which product features (quality, price, service, availability, innovativeness) should I emphasize? How does my product differ from those of competitors?</li>
        <li>How much can I afford to invest in a promotion campaign?</li>
        <li>How do my competitors promote their products? Should I take a similar approach?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_p02">To promote a product, you need to imprint a clear image of it in the minds of your target audience. What do you think of, for instance, when you hear “Ritz-Carlton”? What about “Motel 6”? They’re both hotel chains, but the names certainly conjure up different images. Both have been quite successful in the hospitality industry, but they project very different images to appeal to different clienteles. The differences are evident in their promotions. The Ritz-Carlton Web site describes “luxury hotels” and promises that the chain provides “the finest personal service and facilities throughout the world.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_058">“About Us,” Ritz-Carlton, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://corporate.ritzcarlton.com/en/about/goldstandards.htm">http://corporate.ritzcarlton.com/en/about/goldstandards.htm</a> (accessed October 21, 2011).</span> Motel 6, by contrast, characterizes its facilities as “discount hotels” and assures you that you’ll pay “discount hotel rates.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_059">“Motel 6 Corporate Profile,” Motel 6, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.motel6.com/about/corpprofile.aspx">http://www.motel6.com/about/corpprofile.aspx</a> (accessed October 21, 2011).</span></p>

Ads are everywhere—in print media (such as newspapers, magazines, the <em class="emphasis">Yellow Pages</em>), on billboards, in broadcast media (radio and TV), and on the Internet. It’s hard to escape the constant barrage of advertising messages; indeed, it’s estimated that the average consumer is confronted by about five thousand ad messages each day (compared with about five hundred ads a day in the 1970s).<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111114-102432-270336">Caitlin A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s01_s01_p02">Your choice of advertising media depends on your product, your target audience, and your budget. A travel agency selling spring-break getaways to college students might post flyers on campus bulletin boards or run ads in campus newspapers. A pharmaceutical company trying to develop a market for a new allergy drug might focus on TV ads that reach a broad audience of allergy sufferers. A fitness center might purchase a Google ad that appears next to the search results when someone puts in a relevant keyword, such as fitness. A small hot dog and hamburger stand will probably spend its limited advertising budget on ads in the <em class="emphasis">Yellow Pages</em> and local newspapers (or pay a broke college student to stand by the side of the road dressed in a hot dog costume and hold a sign that entices potential customers to “come on in”). The cofounders of Nantucket Nectars found radio ads particularly effective. Rather than pay professionals, they produced their own ads themselves. (Actually, they just got on the radio and started rambling about their product or their lives or anything else that seemed interesting at the time.)<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111111-111438-135424">Nantucket Allserve, Inc., “Nantucket Nectars from the Beginning,” <a class="link" href="http://www.juiceguys.com">http://www.juiceguys.com</a> (accessed October 13, 2011).</span> As unprofessional as they sounded, the ads worked, and the business grew.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s01_s02_p02">Many retail stores depend on the expertise and enthusiasm of their salespeople to persuade customers to buy. Home Depot has grown into a home-goods giant in large part because it fosters one-on-one interactions between salespeople and customers. The real difference between Home Depot and everyone else, says one of its cofounders, isn’t the merchandise; it’s the friendly, easy-to-understand advice that salespeople give to novice homeowners. Customers who never thought they could fix anything suddenly feel empowered to install a carpet or hang wallpaper.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn09_027">Kevin J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Marketing Robosapien</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p01">Now let’s look more closely at the strategy that Wow Wee pursued in marketing Robosapien in the United States. The company’s goal was ambitious: to promote the robot as a must-have item for kids of all ages. As we know, Wow Wee intended to position Robosapien as a home-entertainment product, not as a toy. The company rolled out the product at Best Buy, which sells consumer electronics, computers, entertainment software, and appliances. As marketers had hoped, the robot caught the attention of consumers shopping for TV sets, DVD players, home and car audio equipment, music, movies, and games. Its $99 price tag was also consistent with Best Buy’s storewide pricing. Indeed, the retail price was a little lower than the prices of other merchandise, and that fact was an important asset: shoppers were willing to treat Robosapien as an <em class="emphasis">impulse item</em>—something extra to pick up as a gift or as a special present for children, as long as the price wasn’t too high.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p02">Meanwhile, Robosapien was also getting lots of free publicity. Stories appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world, including the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, the <em class="emphasis">Times of London, Time</em> magazine, and <em class="emphasis">National Parenting</em> magazine. Commentators on <em class="emphasis">The Today Show, The Early Show</em>, CNN, ABC News, and FOX News remarked on it; it was even the talk of the prestigious New York Toys Fair. It garnered numerous awards, and experts predicted that it would be a hot item for the holidays.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p03">At Wow Wee, Marketing Director Amy Weltman (who had already had a big hit with the Rubik’s Cube) developed a gala New York event to showcase the product. From mid- to late August, actors dressed in six-foot robot costumes roamed the streets of Manhattan, while the fourteen-inch version of Robosapien performed in venues ranging from Grand Central Station to city bars. Everything was recorded, and film clips were sent to TV stations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p04">Then the stage was set for expansion into other stores. Macy’s ran special promotions, floating a twenty-four-foot cold-air robot balloon from its rooftop and lining its windows with armies of Robosapien’s. Wow Wee trained salespeople to operate the product so that they could help customers during in-store demonstrations. Other retailers, including The Sharper Image, Spencer’s, and Toys “R” Us, carried Robosapien, as did e-retailers such as Amazon.com. The product was also rolled out (with the same marketing flair) in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch09_s05_s02_p05">When national advertising hit in September, all the pieces of the marketing campaign came together—publicity, sales promotion, personal selling, and advertising. Wow Wee ramped up production to meet anticipated fourth-quarter demand and waited to see whether Robosapien would live up to commercial expectations.</p>
