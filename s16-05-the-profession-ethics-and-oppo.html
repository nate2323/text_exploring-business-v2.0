        <h2 class="title editable block">Accountant, Audit Thyself?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p01">Consider the following scenario. You feel good that you’ve managed to create <em class="emphasis">relevant, accurate, timely</em> financial statements for your first year in business as The College Shop, but you find that you’re disappointed about one thing—your net income figure. For some time now, you’ve been trying to convince a friend to invest in The College Shop, telling him that the business would bring in at least $40,000 in income during its first year. Every time you review the income statement in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch12_s03#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 12.15 "Income Statement for The College Shop, Year Ended December 31"</a> (shown in abbreviated form below), however, you’re forced to face the fact that you earned just $30,000—$10,000 short of your optimistic projection.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Revenues − Expenses (CGS, operating expenses, interest and taxes) = Net income</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$500,000 − $470,000 = $30,000</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p02">As you stare one more time at your bottom line, you’re wishing that there was some way to change that single bothersome digit and transform $30,000 into $40,000. Then it hits you. You know that it’s not exactly the most upright thing to do, but what if you were to shift half of your first-year advertising expense of $20,000 into your second year of operation? If you did that, then you’d cut the advertising expense on your first-year income statement by $10,000. Now, with your newly acquired understanding of accounting principles, you know that if you reduce expenses on your income statement by $10,000, your net income will increase by the same amount. So just to see what your “revised” income statement would look like, you go ahead and make your hypothetical change. Sure enough, mission accomplished: Your income statement now reports a net income of $40,000—your actual net income of $30,000 plus your upward “adjustment” of $10,000.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Revenues − Expenses (CGS, operating expenses, interest and taxes) = Net income</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$500,000 − $460,000 = $40,000</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p03">Although you now feel even more satisfied than ever with your newfound expertise in accounting strategy, you’re once again forced to stop and think. If you merely change your net income and nothing else, the balance sheet in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch12_s03#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s06_f01">Figure 12.17 "End-of-Year Balance Sheet for The College Shop"</a> won’t balance any more. Why not? Because when you inflated your net income to $40,000 and added it to your beginning owner’s equity balance of $150,000, this increased your owner’s equity by $10,000—from $180,000 to $190,000. To make sure that you’ve accurately assessed the snag in your strategy, you plug in the accounting equation—</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
						<span class="mathphrase">assets = liabilities + owner’s equity</span>
					</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p04">—and this, unfortunately, is what you get:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
			<span class="mathphrase">$360,000 ≠ $180,000 + $190,000.</span>
		</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p05">So, now what? As you ponder the troublesome ramifications of your balance sheet, yet another accounting strategy pops into your head. At the end of the year, you still owed $6,000 for radio ads and $4,000 for newspaper ads—$10,000 that’s included in <em class="emphasis">accounts payable</em> on your year-end balance sheet. What if you just reduced your <em class="emphasis">accounts payable</em> balance by $10,000? If you did that, you’d also reduce by $10,000 the amount under <em class="emphasis">liabilities and owner’s equity</em>, cutting it from $370,000 to $360,000. Wouldn’t that make everything balance? Plugging in the numbers from your latest brainstorm, you now get:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
				<span class="mathphrase">$360,000 = $170,000 + $190,000.</span>
		</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-5300-20111123-113441-959171">That’s more like it. Now you can go ahead and “adjust” your financial statements, satisfied that you’re well on your way to mastering all of the accounting strategy that you’ll need to handle the financial-reporting needs of your new business.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_s03_s01_p01">Unfortunately, you may also be well on your way to becoming the Bernie Ebbers of the small-business set. In 2002, when the giant telecom company WorldCom collapsed under the weight of an $11 billion fraud scheme, CEO Ebbers, who was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy, got twenty-five years in a federal penitentiary (“I don’t know accounting,” he told the judge). And Ebbers wasn’t the only person on the WorldCom payroll who was charged with illegal activities: Accounting department managers went down with him. Betty Vinson, for example, a forty-seven-year-old midlevel accountant who’d followed orders to falsify accounting records, was sentenced to five months in jail. And she was lucky—she got minimal jail time because she cooperated with federal prosecutors.<span class="footnote" id="e892.fwk-collins-fn12_009">See Susan Pulliam, “How Following Orders Can Hurt Your Career,” <em class="emphasis">CFO.com</em>, October 3, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com">http://www.cfo.com</a> (accessed July 22, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-5300-20111123-113752-188941">The damage done at WorldCom spread to innocent employees as well, not to mention investors, creditors, and business partners. In 2001, when Enron, the seventh-largest company in America, melted down in the heat of an investigation into its financial-reporting practices, it took down an entire accounting firm with it—eighty-nine-year-old Arthur Andersen, then one of the “Big Five” public accounting firms. Volumes have been written about what went wrong, but we can pretty much boil it down to this: <em class="emphasis">Enron executives behaved unethically and illegally, and Andersen auditors looked the other way</em>. Instead of performing its role as public watchdog, Andersen was watching its own pocketbook: The accounting firm protected the revenues generated by lucrative consulting contracts with its client instead of protecting the client’s stakeholders. In so doing, Andersen not only shirked its responsibilities as a public auditor but also covered up evidence of its own inappropriate actions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-5300-20111123-113844-141219">In 2002, Andersen gave up its licenses to practice as certified public accountants in the United States, and a company that had employed 85,000 people only 10 years earlier now employs about 200, most of them to deal with lawsuits and to oversee the process of shutting down the company for good.<span class="footnote" id="e892.fwk-collins-fn12_014">See Michael Moffett, <em class="emphasis">What Happened at Enron?</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business Review, July 2004); and Barbara Ley Toffler with Jennifer Reingold, <em class="emphasis">Final Accounting: Ambition, Greed, and the Fall of Arthur Anderse</em>n (New York: Broadway Books, 2003), http://books.google.com (accessed July 22, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_s03_s02_p01">In a very real sense, the issue at the bottom of all this financial misconduct is <em class="emphasis">trustworthiness</em>. As we’ve seen, accountants are supposed to provide <em class="emphasis">users</em> with financial reports that are <em class="emphasis">useful</em> because they’re relevant, timely, and, most important, accurate. It should go without saying that if users—whether internal or external—can’t trust these reports to be accurate, they can’t rely on them to be as useful as they should be. Would you, for instance, invest in or loan money to a company whose financial reports you can’t trust?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-5300-20111123-114105-317911">Which—appropriately—brings us back to you and your little foray into falsifying accounting records. Let’s say that in February of your second year of operations, you have an unexpected opportunity to expand into the vacated store right next to The College Shop. It’s too good to pass up, but you’ll need quite a bit of money to outfit the space and expand your inventory. First, you go to the friend for whose benefit you “adjusted” your financial statements, but he’s just lost a bundle in the stock market and can’t help you out. Your only option, then, is to get a bank loan. So you go to your banker, and some version of the following exchange occurs early in the conversation:</p>

Another thing that you may not know is that accounting is a “people profession.” A lot of people think that accountants spend the day sitting behind desks crunching numbers, but this is a serious misconception. Accountants work with other people to solve business problems. They need strong analytical skills to assess financial data, but they must also be able to work effectively with colleagues. Thus they need good interpersonal skills, and because they must write and speak clearly and present complex financial data in terms that everyone can understand, they need excellent communication skills as well.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch12_s05_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Job Descriptions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s05_s02_p01">If you choose a career in accounting, you have two career options:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-115541-789201">
                <li>Work as a public accountant, whether for a “Big Four” public accounting firm or for a midsize or smaller company</li>
                <li>Work as a private accountant for a business, not-for-profit organization, or government agency</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s05_s02_p02">Let’s take a closer look at these options. Public accounting firms provide clients with accounting and tax services in return for fees. Most members of such firms are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">certified public accountants (CPAs)</a><span class="glossdef">Accountant who has met state-certified requirements for serving the general public rather than a single firm.</span></span> who have met educational and work requirements set by the state and passed a rigorous exam. Although public accounting firms offer consulting and tax services, the hallmark of the profession is performing external <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audits</a><span class="glossdef">Accountant’s examination of and report on a company’s financial statements.</span></span>: the public accountant examines a company’s financial statements and submits an opinion on whether they’ve been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This “stamp of approval” provides the investing public with confidence that a firm’s financial reports are accurate. Typically, public accountants are self-employed, work for small, sometimes regional firms, or are associated with one of the “Big Four” public accounting firms—Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers—or one of the large second-tier public accounting firms, such as BDO Seidman or Grant Thornton.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s05_s02_p03">Often called <em class="emphasis">management</em> or <em class="emphasis">corporate accountants</em>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">private accountants</a><span class="glossdef">Accountant who works for a private organization or government agency.</span></span> may work for specific companies, nonprofit organizations, or government agencies. A firm’s chief accounting officer is called a <strong class="emphasis bold">controller</strong>. As a rule, the controller reports to the organization’s <em class="emphasis">chief financial officer (CFO)</em>, who’s responsible for all of its accounting and other financial activities. The jobs of private accountants vary according to the company or industry in which they’re employed. Most private accountants record and analyze financial information and provide support to other members of the organization in such diverse areas as marketing, strategic planning, new product development, operations, human resources, and finance. Private accountants also conduct <em class="emphasis">internal audits</em>. In this capacity, they ensure that accounting records are accurate, company policies are adhered to, assets are safeguarded, and operations are efficiently conducted. Finally, they may also provide a variety of specialized services:</p>
