            <li>Describe the main systems for sharing information through networked computers.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_p01">Once it’s grown beyond just a handful of employees, an organization needs a way of sharing information. Imagine a flower shop with twenty employees. The person who takes phone orders needs access to the store’s customer list, as do the delivery person and the bookkeeper. Now, the store may have one computer and everyone could share it. It’s more likely, however, that there are a number of computers (several for salespeople, one for delivery, and one for bookkeeping). In this case, everyone needs to be sure that customer records have been updated on all computers every time that a change is required.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s04_s99">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Networks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_p02">Likewise, many companies want their personal computers to run their own software and process data independently. But they also want people to share databases, files, and printers, and they want them to share <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">applications software</a><span class="glossdef">Software that performs a specific task, such as word processing or spreadsheet creation.</span></span> that performs particular tasks, including word processing, creating and managing spreadsheets, designing graphical presentations, and producing high-quality printed documents (<em class="emphasis">desktop publishing</em>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_p03">The solution in both cases is <em class="emphasis">networking</em>—linking computers to one another. The two major types of networks are distinguished according to geographical coverage:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_l02">
            <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">local area network (LAN)</a><span class="glossdef">Network that links computers that are in close proximity.</span></span> links computers that are in close proximity—in the same building or office complex. They can be connected by cables or by wireless technology. Your university might have a LAN system that gives you access to resources, such as registration information, software packages, and printers. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s04_f01">Figure 15.7 "Local Area Network (LAN)"</a> illustrates a LAN that’s connected to another network by means of a <em class="emphasis">gateway</em>—a processor that allows dissimilar networks to communicate with one another.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_l03">
            <li>Because a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wide area network (WAN)</a><span class="glossdef">Network that links computers that are spread over a relatively large geographical area.</span></span> covers a relatively large geographical area, its computers are connected by telephone lines, wireless technology, or even satellite.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_p04">Like the one in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s04_f01">Figure 15.7 "Local Area Network (LAN)"</a>, some networks are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">client-server systems</a><span class="glossdef">System connecting client machines (which are used by employees for data input and retrieval) and a server (that stores shared databases and programs).</span></span>, which include a number of client machines (the ones used by employees for data input and retrieval) and a server (which stores the database and the programs used to process the data). Such a setup saves time and money and circulates more-accurate information.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p99">A cloud is a “visible mass of condensed water vapor floating in the atmosphere, typically high above the ground.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_038">“Cloud,” Dictionary.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cloud">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cloud</a> (accessed November 15, 2011).</span> The term “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cloud computing</a><span class="glossdef">Cloud computing means performing computer tasks using services provided over the Internet.</span></span>” means performing computer tasks using services provided over the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_039">Melanie Pinola, “What Is Cloud Computing?,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/workingontheroad/f/cloudcomputing.htm">http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/workingontheroad/f/cloudcomputing.htm</a> (accessed November 15, 2011).</span> So how do you connect the two definitions? When IT professionals diagrammed computer systems, they used a cloud symbol to represent the Internet. So when you hear or read that an individual or company is using the “cloud” or technology firms, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Salesforce.com, are offering cloud services, just substitute the word “Internet” for “cloud” and things will make sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p98">You might be surprised to learn that you’re already using the cloud—that is if you use Facebook (which is very likely—in fact, just mentioning Facebook here might prompt you to stop studying and check out your friends’ pages). How do you know that Facebook is a cloud application? Remember the trick: just substitute the word “Internet” for “cloud.” The Facebook computer application lets you store information about yourself and share it with others using the Internet.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s04_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Business Applications</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p97">Think about the functional areas of business you’ve explored in this text: accounting, finance, human resources, management, marketing, operations, and product design. Now imagine you’re Katrina Lane, senior vice president and chief technology officer for Caesars Entertainment, who is responsible for the information technology needed to handle multiple tasks in all these functional areas. You’re sitting at your desk when Gary Loveman, chief executive officer of Caesars, walks in and gives you the news. Caesars just purchased the Planet Hollywood Casino and Resort in Las Vegas and will open up two new casinos in Ohio in 2012. This is good news for the company, but it means a lot of work for you and your staff.<em class="emphasis"></em></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s96_p96">You wonder whether this might be the time to outsource some of your computing tasks to a technology firm specializing in cloud computing. You remember an example that really makes sense:<span class="footnote" id="collins-ch15_fn99">Paul Gil, “What Is Cloud Computing?,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/c/f/cloudcomputing.htm">http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/c/f/cloudcomputing.htm</a> (accessed November 15, 2011).</span> Right now, whenever Microsoft comes out with a new version of Word, Caesars has to pay $350 per PC for the latest version. Wouldn’t it make more sense to rent the use of the Microsoft Word program from a cloud vendor for say $5 a month (or $60 a year)? Given that the average time between new releases of Word is two years, your total cost per PC would be $120 (2 × $60)—a savings of about $230 per PC ($350 − $120). Your employees wouldn’t mind; instead of working offline, they would just login to the Internet and work with their online version using the files that were saved for them. And the members of your IT staff would be pleased that they wouldn’t need to install the new version of Word on all your PCs.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p93">In making your final decision (as the pretend chief technology officer for Caesars) you should consider these advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing:</p>
            <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s04_s03_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p92">Shifting some of Caesars’s IT functions to the cloud would produce a number of advantages:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p91">
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Cost Savings</em>—By “renting” software rather than buying it, Caesars can reduce its costs. The monthly fee to “use” the software is generally less than the combined cost of buying, installing, and maintaining the software internally. On the hardware site, housing Caesars’s data in a service provider’s facilities, rather than in-house, reduces the large outlay of cash needed to build and maintain data centers.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Speed of Delivery</em>—Purchasing and installing software and data processing equipment can be time consuming. A cloud computing service provider could get Caesars’s applications up and running in only a few weeks.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Scalable</em>—Caesars is constantly expanding both in the number of casinos it owns and geographically. In this ever-changing environment, it’s difficult to gauge the level of our technology needs. If we overestimate our requirements, we end up paying for technology we don’t need. If we underestimate, efficiency goes down, and the experience for our customers diminishes. By using cloud computing we are able to have exactly what we need at our disposal at any point in time.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Employees Can Be Mobile</em>—The use of cloud computing will free workers from their desks and allow them to work wherever they are. As applications move to the cloud, all that is needed for our employees to connect to their “offices” is the Internet. This mobility benefit also makes it easier for employees to collaborate on projects and connect with others in the company.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Information Technology Staff</em>—Although our current staff is extremely qualified and dedicated, finding experienced and knowledgeable staff is a continuing problem particularly in the casino industry which suffers from historically high turnover. By using cloud computing, we reduce our human resource needs by shifting some of our work to outside vendors who are able to hire and keep well qualified individuals (in part because IT professionals enjoy working for technology companies).</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p90">Although the advantages of moving to a cloud environment outnumber the disadvantages, the following disadvantages are cause for concern:</p>

                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Disruption in Internet Service</em>—If Caesars moves some of its applications to the cloud, its employees can work on these applications on any device and in any location as long as they have an Internet connection. But what if the Internet is unavailable because of a disruption? Depending on the length of the disruption, this could create serious problems for Caesars.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Security</em>—Many companies are reluctant to trust cloud service providers with their data because they’re afraid it might become available to unauthorized individuals or criminals. This is a particular problem for Caesars, which collects and stores sensitive client information and has to constantly be on the lookout for fraudulent activity of staff and customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_044">Joseph Eve, “Cloud Computing as a Security Asset,” Indian Gaming, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="www.indiangaming.com/istore/Apr11_JosephEve.pdf">www.indiangaming.com/istore/Apr11_JosephEve.pdf</a> (accessed November 16, 2011), 60-61.</span>
</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Service Provider System Crash</em>—Organizations considering moving to the cloud are justifiably concerned about the possibility of a computer service crash at their service providers’ facilities. It looks like this concern was warranted. In April of 2011, Amazon Web Service (a leading cloud services provider) experienced an outage in one of its large web-connected data centers. The outage crashed its system and brought down the Web sites of a number of companies, including the location-based social network, Foursquare.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_045">Steve Lohr, “Amazon’s Trouble Raises Cloud Computing Doubts,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, April 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/technology/23cloud.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/technology/23cloud.html?_r=1</a> (accessed November 16, 2011).</span> It took more than thirty-six hours to get all seventy or so of the crashed sites up and running.</li>
