        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s01_p01">Customers are the most important asset that any business has. Without enough good customers, no company can survive, and to survive, a firm must not only attract new customers but, perhaps more importantly, also hold on to its current customers. Why? Because repeat customers are more profitable. It’s estimated that it costs as much as six times more to attract and sell to a new customer than to an existing one.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_065">Randall B. Bean, “We’re Not There Yet,” <em class="emphasis">Direct Marketing Business Intelligence</em>, September 30, 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_not_yet/index.html">http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_not_yet/index.html</a> (accessed October 13, 2011).</span> Repeat customers also tend to spend more, and they’re much more likely to recommend you to other people.</p>

The underlying theory is fairly basic: to keep customers happy, you treat them well, give them what they want, listen to them, reward them with discounts and other loyalty incentives, and deal effectively with their complaints.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s01_p03">Take Caesars Entertainment Corporation (formerly Harrah’s Entertainment), which operates more than fifty casinos under several brands, including Caesars, Harrah’s, Bally’s, and Horseshoe. Each year, it sponsors the World Series of Poker with a top prize of $9 million. Caesars gains some brand recognition when the twenty-two-hour event is televised on ESPN, but the real benefit derives from the information cards filled out by the seven thousand entrants who put up $10,000 for a chance to walk away with $9 million. Data from these cards is fed into Caesars database, and almost immediately every entrant starts getting special attention, including party invitations, free entertainment tickets, and room discounts. The program is all part of Harrah’s strategy for targeting serious gamers and recognizing them as its best customers.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_066">“Two Remain at World Series of Poker,” ESPN Poker, November 7, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/poker/news/story?id=5776591&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines">http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/poker/news/story?id=5776591&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines</a> (accessed October 22,2011); Stephane Fitch, “Stacking the Deck: Harrah’s Wants Your Money,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, July 5, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2004/0705/132.html">http://www.forbes.com/business/forbes/2004/0705/132.html</a> (accessed May 21, 2006).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s01_p04">Sheraton Hotels uses a softer approach to entice return customers. Sensing that its resorts needed both a new look and a new strategy for attracting repeat customers, Sheraton launched its “Year of the Bed” campaign: in addition to replacing all its old beds with luxurious new mattresses and coverings, it issued a “service promise guarantee”—a policy that any guest who’s dissatisfied with his or her Sheraton stay will be compensated. The program also calls for a customer-satisfaction survey and discount offers, both designed to keep the hotel chain in touch with its customers.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_067">“Sheraton Hotels Lure Travelers with the Promise of a Good Night's Sleep in New $12 Million Television and Print Ad Campaign,” Hotel News Resource, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article10706Sheraton_Hotels_Lure_Travelers_with_the_Promise_of_a_Good_Night_s_Sleep_in_New_____Million_Television_and_Print_Ad_Campaign.html">http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article10706Sheraton_Hotels_Lure_Travelers_with_the_Promise_of_a_Good_Night_s_ Sleep_in_New_____Million_Television_and_Print_Ad_Campaign.html</a> (accessed October 22, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s01_p05">Another advantage of keeping in touch with customers is the opportunity to offer them additional products. Amazon.com is a master at this strategy. When you make your first purchase at Amazon.com, you’re also making a lifelong “friend”—one who will suggest (based on what you’ve bought before) other things that you might like to buy. Because Amazon.com continually updates its data on your preferences, the company gets better at making suggestions. Now that the Internet firm has expanded past books, Amazon.com can draw on its huge database to promote a vast range of products, and shopping for a variety of products at Amazon.com appeals to people who value time above all else.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Permission versus Interruption Marketing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s01_s01_p01">Underlying Amazon.com’s success in communicating with customers is the fact that customers have given the company permission to contact them. Companies that ask for customers’ cooperation engage in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">permission marketing</a><span class="glossdef">Form of marketing in which companies ask customers or potential customers for permission to contact them or send them marketing materials.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_068">Seth Godin, <em class="emphasis">Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends, and Friends into Customers</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), 40–52.</span> The big advantage is focusing on an audience of people who have already shown an interest in what they have to offer.

Because winning and keeping customers means giving them incentives, Caesars lets high rollers sleep and eat free (or at a deep discount), Norwegian Cruise Line gives members of its past guest program, Latitudes, discounts on sailings, priority check-in, and members-only cocktail parties. Customer-relations management and permission marketing have actually been around for a long time. But recent advances in technology, especially the Internet, now allow companies to practice these approaches in more cost-effective ways.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s02_p01">In the last five years, the popularity of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social media marketing</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of including social media as part of a company’s marketing program.</span></span> has exploded. Most likely you already know what social media is—you use it every day when you connect to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, or any number of other online sites that allow you to communicate with others, network, and bookmark and share your opinions, ideas, photos, and videos. So what is social media marketing? Quite simply social media marketing is the practice of including social media as part of a company’s marketing program.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s02_p02">Why do businesses use social media marketing? Before responding, ask yourself these questions: How much time do I spend watching TV? When I watch TV, do I sit through the ads? Do I read the newspaper? What about magazines—when was the last time I sat for hours reading a magazine, including the ads? How do I spend my spare time? Now, put yourself in the place of Annie Young-Scrivner, global chief marketing officer of Starbucks. Does it make sense for her to spend millions of dollars to place an ad for Starbucks on TV or in a newspaper or magazine? Or should she instead spend the money on social media marketing initiatives that have a high probability of connecting to Starbucks’s market?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s02_p03">For companies like Starbucks, the answer is clear. The days of trying to reach customers through ads on TV, in newspapers, or in magazines are over. Most television watchers skip over commercials (or avoid the ads by using TiVo), and few Starbucks’s customers read newspapers or magazines, and even if they do, they don’t focus on the ads. Social media marketing provides a number of advantages to companies, including enabling them to:<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_070">Devon G.

            <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s02_s01_p01">When PepsiCo announced it wouldn’t show a television commercial during the 2010 Super Bowl game, it came as a surprise (probably a pleasant one to its competitor, Coca-Cola, who had already signed on to show several Super Bowl commercials). What PepsiCo planned to do instead was invest $20 million into social media marketing campaigns. One of PepsiCo’s most successful social media initiatives was to extend the DEWmocracy campaign, which two years earlier, resulted in the launch of product—Voltage—created by Mountain Dew fans. DEWmocracy 2 was a yearlong marketing campaign designed to create another Mountain Dew drink. The campaign was rolled out nationally in seven stages and engaged a number of social media outlets, including an online community of enthusiastic fans of Mountain Dew, Twitter, USTREAM (a live video streaming website), a 12secondTV.com video contest, and a dedicated YouTube channel.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_072">Matthew Yeomans, “Mountain Dew’s Ongoing Dewmocracy—Ripping Up the Book on Campaigns,” SMI, January 29, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialmediainfluence.com/2010/01/29/mountain-dews-ongoing-dewmocracy-ripping-up-the-book-on-campaigns/">http://socialmediainfluence.com/2010/01/29/mountain-dews-ongoing-dewmocracy-ripping-up-the-book-on-campaigns/</a> (accessed October 28, 2011); Jennifer Cirillo, “DEWmocracy 2 Continues to Buzz,” <em class="emphasis">Beverage World</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.beverageworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=37525&amp;catid=34">http://www.beverageworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=37525&amp;catid=34</a> (accessed October 28, 2011).</span> According to Mountain Dew’s director of marketing, the goal of the campaign was “to engage in a direct dialogue with our consumers.

It was likely a little jealous of its competitor, Coca-Cola, who was very effective at combining its Super Bowl ads with a social media campaign. Facebook fans who went online and donated $1 to the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America received an image of a Coca-Cola bottle to post on their Facebook page and a twenty-second sneak preview of one of Coca-Cola’s Super Bowl ads.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_076">“Coca-Cola Virtual Gifts Trigger Peek at Super Bowl Ads,” <em class="emphasis">Promo</em>, February 4, 2010,

It even rewards you for doing business with sponsor companies, such as Starbucks. The individual with the most “check in’s” at a particular Starbucks holds the title of mayor. For a period of time, the mayor of each store got $1 off a Frappuccino.

It performed equally well on Facebook’s event page where almost 600,000 people joined their friends and signed up as “attendees.” This is not surprising given that Starbucks is the most popular brand on Facebook and the first to reach the 10-million fan mark.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_084">Mark Walsh, “Starbucks Tops 10 Million Facebook Fans,” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Daily</em>, Jul 14, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/132008/">http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/132008/</a> (accessed October 28, 2011).</span></p>

According to social media marketing experts, Starbucks earned this notoriety by making social media a central part of its marketing mix, distributing special offers, discounts, and coupons to Facebook users and placing ads on Facebook to drive traffic to its page. As explained by the CEO of Buddy Media, which oversees the brand’s social media efforts, “Starbucks has provided Facebook users a reason to become a fan.”<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_085">Adam Ostrow, “Starbucks Free Pastry Day: A Social Media Triple Shot,” <em class="emphasis">Mashable Social Media</em>, July 21, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mashable.com/2009/07/21/starbucks-free-pastry-day/">http://mashable.com/2009/07/21/starbucks-free-pastry-day/</a> (accessed October 28, 2011).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="e858.collins-ch09_s10_s02_s03_p01">The main challenge of social media marketing is that it can be very time consuming. It takes determination and resources to succeed. Small companies often lack the staff to initiate and manage social media marketing campaigns.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_087">Susan Ward, “Social Media Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/socialmedia/g/socmedmarketing.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/socialmedia/g/socmedmarketing.htm</a> (accessed October 25, 2011).</span> Even large companies can find the management of media marketing initiates overwhelming. A recent study of 1,700 chief marketing officers indicates that many are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of customer data available on social sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_088">Georgina Prodhan, “Marketers Struggle to Harness Social Media—Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Reuters</em>, October 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/socialmedia-ibm-idUSL5E7LA3JO20111011">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/socialmedia-ibm-idUSL5E7LA3JO20111011</a> (accessed October 28, 2011).</span> This is not surprising given that Facebook has more than eight hundred million active users, and two hundred million tweets are sent each day. The marketing officers recognize the potential value of this data but are not capable of using it. A chief marketing officer in the survey described the situation as follows: “The perfect solution is to serve each consumer individually. The problem? There are 7 billion of them.”<span class="footnote" id="e858.fwk-collins-fn09_089">Georgina Prodhan, “Marketers Struggle to Harness Social Media—Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Reuters</em>, October 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/socialmedia-ibm-idUSL5E7LA3JO20111011">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/socialmedia-ibm-idUSL5E7LA3JO20111011</a> (accessed October 28, 2011).</span> In spite of these limitations, 82 percent of those surveyed plan to increase their use of social media marketing over the next 3 to 5 years. To understand what real-time information is telling them, companies will use analytics software, which is capable of analyzing unstructured data. This software is being developed by technology companies, such as IBM, and advertising agencies.</p>
