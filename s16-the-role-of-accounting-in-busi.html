What’s a quick way to find out where they are and what they’re up to? If you’re signed up, you can “check in” with the Foursquare app on your smartphone, tablet PC, or whatever device you use to connect to a wireless network. Foursquare is a mobile social network, and in addition to the handy “friend finder” feature, you can use it to find new and interesting places around your neighborhood to do whatever you and your friends like to do. It even rewards you for doing business with sponsor companies, such as local restaurants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-160513-122914">Foursquare, which has been getting a lot of buzz lately, was started in 2009 by two young entrepreneurs, Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai. It’s already attracted more than a million users, and Crowley and Selvadurai are understandably enthusiastic about their prospects. Not everybody, however, is as optimistic as they are. Right now, Foursquare is bringing in money and growing, but let’s face facts—it’s a start-up and it’s barely two years old. Among the experts who pay attention to the business of software apps, Foursquare has both optimists and skeptics, and, as usual, there a lot of people who think that Crowley and Selvadurai should take the money and run—that is, sell out to a larger company and move on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-160614-948876">Clearly, Crowley and Selvadurai have some questions to answer and—at some point, if not necessarily right now—decisions to make. This is where they’ll have to rely on an accountant, because they’ll need somebody with a knowledge of accounting to help them ask and answer the right questions and formulate and make the right decisions: How much revenue are we bringing in? Can we increase it? What are our expenses? Will they continue to get higher or can we cut them? How much money are we actually making? Are we operating at a profit or a loss? How much do we have invested in the company? How much debt do we have? Can we pay our bills on time? If we need more money, where can we get it? How much cash do we have on hand? How much cash comes in each month and how much goes out? How long will it last? How much is our business really worth? If we decide to sell it, how much should we ask for it? Is it a good idea to put more of our own money into the venture? What are the odds that Foursquare will succeed?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-160638-400935">In this chapter, we’ll learn how to gather, summarize, and interpret accounting information and how to use it in making business decisions like the ones facing Crowley and Selvadurai.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s01_p01">Accounting is often called “the language of business.” Why? Because it <em class="emphasis">communicates</em> so much of the information that owners, managers, and investors need to evaluate a company’s financial performance. These people are all <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stakeholders</a><span class="glossdef">Parties who are interested in the activities of a business because they’re affected by them.</span></span> in the business—they’re interested in its activities because they’re affected by them. In fact, the purpose of accounting is to help stakeholders make better business decisions by providing them with financial information. Obviously, you wouldn’t try to run an organization or make investment decisions without accurate and timely financial information, and it’s the accountant who prepares this information. More importantly, accountants make sure that stakeholders understand the <em class="emphasis">meaning</em> of financial information, and they work with both individuals and organizations to help them use financial information to deal with business problems. Actually, collecting all the numbers is the easy part—today, all you have to do is start up your accounting software. The hard part is analyzing, interpreting, and communicating the information. Of course, you also have to present everything clearly while effectively interacting with people from every business discipline. In any case, we’re now ready to define <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounting</a><span class="glossdef">System for measuring and summarizing business activities, interpreting financial information, and communicating the results to management and other decision makers.</span></span> as the process of measuring and summarizing business activities, interpreting financial information, and communicating the results to management and other decision makers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-161943-519696">Accountants typically work in one of two major fields. <em class="emphasis">Management accountants</em> provide information and analysis to decision makers <em class="emphasis">inside</em> the organization in order to help them run it. <em class="emphasis">Financial accountants</em> furnish information to individuals and groups <em class="emphasis">both inside and outside</em> the organization in order to help them assess its financial performance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-162031-347012">In other words, management accounting helps you keep your business running while financial accounting tells you how well you’re running it.</p>

Reports are tailored to the needs of individual managers, and the purpose of such reports is to supply <em class="emphasis">relevant, accurate, timely information</em> in a format that will aid managers in making decisions.

Users want to be sure that financial statements have been prepared according to GAAP because they want to be sure that the information reported in them is accurate.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111122-163655-885592">While companies headquartered in the United States follow U.S.-based GAAP, many companies located outside the United States follow a different set of accounting principles called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</a><span class="glossdef">A set of worldwide accounting rules and guidelines used by companies to prepare financial statements that can be compared with those of other countries.</span></span>. These multinational standards, which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)<strong class="emphasis bold"></strong>, differ from U.S. GAAP in a number of important ways. IFRS, for example, is a little stricter about the ways you can calculate the costs of inventory, but we’re not going to dwell unnecessarily on such fine distinctions. Bear in mind, however, that, according to most experts, a single set of worldwide standards will eventually emerge to govern the accounting practices of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p01">In summarizing the outcomes of a company’s financial activities over a specified period of time, financial statements are, in effect, report cards for owners and managers. They show, for example, whether the company did or didn’t make a profit and furnish other information about the firm’s financial condition. They also provide information that managers and owners can use in order to take corrective action.</p>

Investors and creditors furnish the money that a company needs to operate, and not surprisingly, they feel the same way. Because they know that it’s impossible to make smart investment and loan decisions without accurate reports on an organization’s financial health, they study financial statements to assess a company’s performance and to make decisions about continued investment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e881.collins-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p02">According to the world’s most successful investor (and third-richest individual), Warren Buffett, the best way to prepare yourself to be an investor is to learn all the accounting you can. Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a company that invests in other companies, turned an original investment of $10,000 into a net worth of $35 billion in four decades, and he did it, in large part, by paying close attention to financial accounting reports.<span class="footnote" id="e881.fwk-collins-fn12_007">John Price, “The Return of the Buffetteers,” <em class="emphasis">Investor Journal</em>, August 1998, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sherlockinvesting.com">http://www.sherlockinvesting.com</a> (accessed July 17, 2010).</span></p>

Publicly owned companies, for example—the ones whose shares are traded on a stock exchange—must provide annual financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a federal agency that regulates stock trades. Companies must also provide financial information to local, state, and federal taxing agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

Suppliers, for example, need to know if the company to which they sell their goods is having trouble paying its bills or may even be at risk of going under. Employees and labor unions are interested because salaries and other forms of compensation are dependent on an employer’s performance.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_p01">We hope that, so far, we’ve made at least one thing clear: If you’re in business, you need to understand financial statements. For one thing, the law no longer allows high-ranking executives to plead ignorance or fall back on delegation of authority when it comes to taking responsibility for a firm’s financial reporting. In a business environment tainted by episodes of fraudulent financial reporting and other corporate misdeeds, top managers are now being held accountable (so to speak) for the financial statements issued by the people who report to them. For another thing, top managers need to know if the company is hitting on all cylinders or sputtering down the road to bankruptcy. To put it another way (and to switch metaphors): if he didn’t understand the financial statements issued by the company’s accountants, an executive would be like an airplane pilot who doesn’t know how to read the instrument in the cockpit—he might be able keep the plane in the air for a while, but he wouldn’t recognize any signs of impending trouble until it was too late.</p>

So let’s assume that you need to earn money while you’re in college and that you’ve decided to start a small business. Your business will involve selling stuff to other college students, and to keep things simple, we’ll assume that you’re going to operate on a “cash” basis: you’ll pay for everything with cash, and everyone who buys something from you will pay in cash.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">A Word about Cash.</em> You probably have at least a little <em class="emphasis">cash</em> on you right now—some currency, or paper money, and coins. In accounting, however, the term <em class="emphasis">cash</em> refers to more than just paper money and coins. It also refers to the money that you have in checking and savings accounts and includes items that you can deposit in these accounts, such as money orders and different types of checks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-075826-558960">Your first task is to decide exactly what you’re going to sell. You’ve noticed that with homework, exams, social commitments, and the hectic lifestyle of the average college student, you and most of the people you know always seem to be under a lot of stress. Sometimes you wish you could just lie back between meals and bounce a ball off the wall. And that’s when the idea hits you: Maybe you could make some money by selling a product called the “Stress-Buster Play Pack.” Here’s what you have in mind: you’ll buy small toys and other fun stuff—instant stress relievers—at a local dollar store and pack them in a rainbow-colored plastic treasure chest labeled “Stress-Buster.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-075902-566207">And here’s where you stand: You have enough cash to buy a month’s worth of plastic treasure chests and toys. After that, you’ll use the cash generated from sales of Stress-Buster Play Packs to replenish your supply. Each plastic chest will cost $1.00, and you’ll fill each one with a variety of five of the following toys, all of which you can buy for $1.00 each:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-080037-761756">
                <li>A happy face stress ball</li>
                <li>A roomarang (an indoor boomerang)</li>
                <li>Some silly putty</li>
                <li>An inflatable beach ball</li>
                <li>A coil “slinky” spring</li>
                <li>A paddle-ball game</li>
                <li>A ball for bouncing off walls</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">You plan to sell each Stress-Buster Play Pack for $10 from a rented table stationed outside a major dining hall. Renting the table will cost you $20 a month. Because your own grades aren’t what your parents and the dean would like them to be, you decide to hire fellow students (trustworthy people with better grades than yours) to staff the table at peak traffic periods. They’ll be on duty from noon until 2:00 p.m. each weekday, and you’ll pay them $6 an hour. Wages, therefore, will cost you $240 a month (2 hours × 5 days × 4 weeks = 40 hours × $6). Finally, you’ll run ads in the college newspaper at a monthly cost of $40. Thus your total monthly costs will amount to $300 ($20 + $240 + $40).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What If You Want to Make More Money?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold"></strong>You’re quite relieved to see that you made a profit during your first month, but you can’t help but wonder what you’ll have to do to make even more money next month. You consider three possibilities:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Reduce your cost of goods sold (say, package four toys instead of five)</li>
            <li>Reduce your operating costs (salaries, advertising, table rental)</li>
            <li>Increase the quantity of units sold</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p05">In order to consider these possibilities fully, you need to generate new income statements for each option. And to do that, you’ll have to play a few “what-if” games. Because possibility #1—packaging four toys instead of five—is the most appealing, you start there. Your cost of goods sold would go down from $6 to $5 per unit (4 toys at $1 each + 1 plastic treasure chest at $1). <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s02_f02">Figure 12.6 "Proposed Income Statement Number One for Stress-Buster Company"</a> is your hypothetical income statement if you choose this option.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_f02">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 12.6</span> Proposed Income Statement Number One for Stress-Buster Company</p>
            <img src="section_16/f0512f21741e847e3be2eca2bc06f532.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p06">Possibility #1 seems to be a good idea. Under this scenario, your income doubles from $100 to $200 because your per-unit <em class="emphasis">gross profit</em> increases by $1 (and you sold 100 stress packs). But there may be a catch: If you cut back on the number of toys, your customers might perceive your product as a lesser value for the money. In fact, you’re reminded of a conversation that you once had with a friend whose father, a restaurant owner, had cut back on the cost of the food he served by buying less expensive meat. In the short term, gross profit per meal went up, but customers eventually stopped coming back and the restaurant nearly went out of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p07">Thus you decide to consider possibility #2—reducing your operating costs. In theory, it’s a good idea, but in practice—at least in your case—it probably won’t work. Why not? For one thing, you can’t do without the table and you need your workers (because your grades haven’t improved, you still don’t have time to sit at the table yourself). Second, if you cut salaries from, say, $6 to $5 an hour, you may have a hard time finding people willing to work for you. Finally, you could reduce advertising costs by running an ad every two weeks instead of every week, but this tactic would increase your income by only $20 a month and could easily lead to a drop in sales.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p08">Now you move on to possibility #3—increase sales. The appealing thing about this option is that it has no downside. If you could somehow increase the number of units sold from 100 Stress-Buster packs per month to 150, your income would go up, even if you stick with your original five-toy product. So you decide to crunch some numbers for possibility #3 and come up with the new “what-if” income statement in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s02_f03">Figure 12.7 "Proposed Income Statement Number Two for Stress-Buster Company"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p09">As you can see, this is an attractive possibility, even though you haven’t figured out how you’re going to increase sales (maybe you could put up some eye-popping posters and play cool music to attract people to your table.

In our Stress-Buster illustration, we’ve assumed that all your transactions have been made in <em class="emphasis">cash</em>: You paid cash for your inputs (plastic treasure chests and toys) and for your other expenses, and your customers paid cash when they bought Stress-Buster packs. In the real world, of course, things are rarely that simple. In the following cases, timing plays a role in making and receiving payments:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_l02">
        <li>Customers don’t always pay in cash; they often buy something and pay later. When this happens, the seller is owed money and has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">account receivable</a><span class="glossdef">Record of cash that will be received from a customer to whom a business has sold products on credit.</span></span> (it will <em class="emphasis">receive</em> something later).</li>
        <li>Companies don’t generally pay cash for materials and other expenses—they often pay later. If this is the case, the buyer has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">account payable</a><span class="glossdef">Record of cash owed to sellers from whom a business has purchased products on credit.</span></span> (it will <em class="emphasis">pay</em> something later).</li>
        <li>Many companies manufacture or buy goods and hold them in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inventory</a><span class="glossdef">Goods that a business has made or bought and expects to sell in the process of normal operations.</span></span> before selling them. Under these circumstances, they don’t report payment for the goods until they’ve been sold.</li>
        <li>Companies buy <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em> (also called <em class="emphasis">fixed assets</em>), such as cars, buildings, and equipment, which they plan to use over an extended period (as a rule, for more than one year).</li>

Here are a few basic principles of accrual accounting:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_l04">
            <li>A sale is recognized on the income statement <em class="emphasis">when it takes place</em>, regardless of when cash is collected.</li>
            <li>An expense is recognized on the income statement <em class="emphasis">when it’s incurred</em>, regardless of when payment is made.</li>
            <li>An item manufactured for later sale or bought for resale becomes part of <em class="emphasis">inventory</em> and appears on the balance sheet <em class="emphasis">until it’s actually sold</em>; at that point, it goes on the income statement under <em class="emphasis">cost of goods sold</em>.</li>
            <li>A <em class="emphasis">long-term asset</em> that will be used for several years—for example, a vehicle, machine, or building—appears on the balance sheet. Its cost is spread <em class="emphasis">over its useful life</em>—the number of years that it will be used.

So let’s now assume that you successfully operated the Stress-Buster Company while you were in college. Now fast-forward to graduation, and rather than work for someone else, you’ve decided to set up a more ambitious business—some kind of retail outlet—close to the college. During your four years in school, you noticed that there was no store near campus that met the wide range of students’ specific needs. Thus the mission of your proposed retail business: to provide products that satisfy the specific needs of college students.</p>

                <li>You’ve bought furniture and equipment that you’ll use over the next five years. You’ll allocate the cost of these long-term assets by depreciating them.

                <li>You’ve purchased an inventory of goods for later resale.</li>
                <li>You’ve taken out two types of loans: one that’s <em class="emphasis">current</em> because it’s payable in one year and one that’s <em class="emphasis">long term</em> because it’s due in five years.</li>

Naturally, the bank charges you <em class="emphasis">interest</em> (which is the cost of borrowing money); your rate is 8 percent per year.

Of this amount, $50,000 is in <em class="emphasis">cash</em>—that is, money deposited in the company’s checking and other bank accounts. You used another $75,000 to pay for <em class="emphasis">inventory</em> that you’ll sell throughout the year.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_p02">Note, by the way, that the income statement that we prepared for The College Shop is designed for a <em class="emphasis">merchandiser</em>—a company that makes a profit by selling goods. How can you tell? Businesses that sell services (such as accounting firms or airlines) rather than merchandise don’t have lines labeled <em class="emphasis">cost of goods sold</em> on their statements.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_p03">The format of this income statement also highlights the most important financial fact in running a merchandising company: <em class="emphasis">you must sell goods at a profit (called</em> gross profit<em class="emphasis">) that is high enough to cover your operating costs, interest, and taxes</em>. Your income statement, for example, shows that The College Shop generated $225,000 in <em class="emphasis">gross profit</em> through <em class="emphasis">sales</em> of goods. This amount is sufficient to cover your <em class="emphasis">operating expense</em>, interest, and taxes and still produce a <em class="emphasis">net income</em> of $30,000.</p>

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Depreciation expense</em>. Recall that before opening for business, you purchased some long-term assets (store sign, displays, furniture, and equipment) for a total amount of $150,000. In estimating that you would use these assets for five years (your estimate of their useful lives), you spread the cost of $150,000 over five years. For each of these five years, then, your income statement will show $30,000 in <em class="emphasis">depreciation</em><em class="emphasis"> expense</em> ($150,000 ÷ 5 years = $30,000).</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Interest expense</em>. When you borrowed money from the bank, you agreed to pay interest at an annual rate of 8 percent. Your <em class="emphasis">interest</em><em class="emphasis"> expense</em> of $10,000 ($125,000 × 0.08) is a cost of financing your business and appears on your income statement after the subheading <em class="emphasis">operating income</em>.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Income taxes</em>. Your company has to pay income taxes at a rate of 25 percent of <em class="emphasis">net income before taxes</em>. This amount of $10,000 ($40,000 × 25%) appears on your income statement after the subheading <em class="emphasis">net income before income taxes</em>.

First, look at your assets. At year’s end, you have a <em class="emphasis">cash balance</em> of $70,000 and <em class="emphasis">inventory</em> of $80,000. You also have an <em class="emphasis">accounts receivable</em> of $90,000 because many of your customers have bought goods on credit and will pay later. In addition, the balance sheet now shows two numbers for <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em>: the original cost of these assets, $150,000, and an <em class="emphasis">accumulated depreciation</em> amount of $30,000, which reflects the amount that you’ve charged as depreciation expense since the purchase of the assets. The carrying value of these long-term assets is now $120,000 ($150,000 - $30,000), which is the difference between their original cost and the amount that they’ve been depreciated.

Indeed, each tells its own story. The balance sheet tells what assets your company has now and where they came from. The income statement reports earned income on an accrual basis (recognizing revenues when earned and expenses as incurred regardless of when cash is received or paid). But the key to surviving in business is generating the <em class="emphasis">cash</em> you need to keep it up and running. It’s not unusual to hear reports about companies with cash problems. Sometimes they arise because the products in which the firm has invested aren’t selling as well as it had forecast. Maybe the company tied up too much money in a plant that’s too big for its operations. Maybe it sold products to customers who can’t pay. Maybe management just overspent. Whatever the reason, cash problems will hamper any business. Owners and other interested parties need a financial statement that helps them understand a company’s cash flow.</p>

The net result was an increase in cash of $20,000. This $20,000 increase in cash agrees with the change in your cash during the year as it’s reported in your balance sheets: You had an end-of-the-year cash balance of $70,000 and a beginning-of-the-year balance of $50,000 ($70,000 − $50,000 = $20,000).

You paid out $1,000 for gasoline, lawn mower repairs, and other expenses, including $100 for a lawn mower tune-up that you haven’t paid for yet.

As you stare at the statement, you’re asking yourself the question: Why did my profit go down even though my sales went up? Does this result make sense? Is there some way of comparing two income statements that will give me a more helpful view of my company’s financial health? One way is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vertical percentage analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Analysis of an income statement treating the relationship of each item as a percentage of a base (usually sales).</span></span>.

Operating expenses (salaries, rent, advertising, and so forth) used up $0.35 of every $1.00 of sales, while interest and taxes took up $0.02 each. After you covered all your costs, you had $0.06 profit for every $1.00 of sales.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p01">Now, compare these figures to those for year 2. Where is the major discrepancy? It’s in <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em>. Instead of using $0.55 of every $1.00 of sales to buy the goods you sold, you used $0.64. As a result, you had $0.09 less ($0.64 – $0.55) to cover other costs. This is the major reason why you weren’t as profitable in year 2 as you were in year 1: your <em class="emphasis">Gross profit as a percentage of sales</em> was lower in year 2 than it was in year 1. Though this information doesn’t give you all the answers you’d like to have, it does, however, raise some interesting questions. Why was there a change in the relationship between <em class="emphasis">Sales</em> and <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em>? Did you have to pay more to buy goods for resale and, if so, were you unable to increase your selling price to cover the additional cost? Did you have to reduce prices to move goods that weren’t selling well? (If your costs stay the same but your selling price goes down, you make less on each item sold.) Answers to these questions require further analysis, but at least you know what the useful questions are.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_p01">Vertical percentage analysis helps you analyze relationships between items on your income statement. But how do you compare your financial results with those of other companies in your industry or with the industry overall? And what about your balance sheet? Are there relationships on this statement that also warrant investigation? Should you further examine any relationships between items on your income statement and items on your balance sheet? These issues can be explored by using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ratio analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Technique for financial analysis that shows the relationship between two numbers.</span></span>, a technique for evaluating a company’s financial performance.</p>

Rather, the value in ratio analysis lies in looking at the <em class="emphasis">trend</em> of ratios over time and in comparing the ratios for several time periods with those of competitors and the industry as a whole. There are a number of different ways to categorize financial ratios. Here’s just one set of categories:</p>

But how can you tell whether your gross profit margin for year 2 is appropriate for your company? For one thing, we can use it to compare The College Shop’s results to those of its industry. When we make this comparison, we find that the specialized retail industry (in which your company operates) reports an average gross profit margin of 41 percent. For year 1, therefore, we had a higher ratio than the industry; in year 2, though we had a lower ratio, we were still in the proverbial ballpark.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s01_p03">It’s worthwhile to track gross profit margin, whether for your company or for companies that you might invest in or lend money to. In particular, you’ll gain some insight into <em class="emphasis">changes</em> that might be occurring in a business. For instance, what if you discover that a firm’s gross profit margin has declined?

Even if you rent space, for example, you must still buy furniture and equipment. To have products on hand to sell, you need to tie up money in inventory. And once you’ve sold them, you may have money tied up in accounts receivable while you’re waiting for customers to pay you. Thus, investing in assets is a normal part of doing business. Managing your assets efficiently is a basic requirement of business success. Let’s look at a representative management efficiency ratio.

Holding onto inventory for an extra 9 days (67 days for year 2 minus 58 days for year 1) is costly. What happened? Perhaps inventory levels were too high because you overstocked. It’s good to have products available for customers, but stocking too much inventory is costly. Maybe some of your inventory takes a long time to sell because it’s not as appealing to customers as you thought. If this is the case, you may have a problem for the next year because you’ll have to cut prices (and reduce profitability) in order to sell the same slow-moving inventory.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s03_p06">Optimal inventory turnover varies by industry and even by company. A supermarket, for example, will have a high inventory turnover because many of its products are perishable and because it makes money by selling a high volume of goods (making only pennies on each sale). A company that builds expensive sailboats, by contrast, will have a low inventory turnover: it sells few boats but makes a hefty profit on each one. Some companies, such as Dell Computer, are known for keeping extremely low inventory levels. Because computers are made to order, Dell maintains only minimal inventory and so enjoys a very high ratio of sales to inventory.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s01_p02">The College Shop’s current ratio indicates that, in year 1, the company had $3.00 in current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities. In the second year, the company had $4.00 of current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities. The average current ratio for the industry is 2.42. The good news is that The College Shop should have no trouble meeting its current obligations. The bad news is that, ironically, its current ratio might be too high: companies should have enough liquid assets on hand to meet current obligations, but not too many. Holding excess cash can be costly when there are alternative uses for it, such as paying down loans or buying assets that can generate revenue. Perhaps The College Shop should reduce its current assets by using some of its cash to pay a portion of its debt.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p02">In year 1, the ratio of 1 indicates that The College Shop has an equal amount of equity and debt (for every $1.00 of equity, it has $1.00 of debt). But this proportion changes in year 2, when the company has more equity than debt: for every $1.00 of equity, it now has $0.85 in debt. How does this ratio compare to that of the industry? The College Shop, it seems, is heavy on the debt side: the industry average of 0.49 indicates that, on average, companies in the industry have only $0.49 of debt for every $1.00 of equity. Its high debt-to-equity ratio might make it hard for The College Shop to borrow more money in the future.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p03">How much difference can this problem make to a business when it needs funding? Consider the following example. Say that you have two friends, both of whom want to borrow money from you. You’ve decided to loan money to only one of them. Both are equally responsible, but you happen to know that one has only $100 in the bank and owes $1,000. The other also has $100 in the bank but owes only $50. To which one would you lend money? The first has a debt-to-equity ratio of 10 ($1,000 debt to $100 equity) and the second a ratio of 0.50 ($50 debt to $100 equity). You—like a banker—will probably lend money to the friend with the better debt-to-equity ratio, even though the other one needs the money more.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p04">It’s possible, however, for a company to make its interest payments comfortably even though it has a high debt-to-equity ratio. Thus, it’s helpful to compute the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest coverage ratio</a><span class="glossdef">Financial ratio showing a company’s ability to pay interest on its debts from its operating income.</span></span>, which measures the number of times that a firm’s operating income can cover its interest expense. We compute this ratio by examining the relationship between interest expense and operating income. A high-interest coverage ratio indicates that a company can easily make its interest payments; a low ratio suggests trouble. Here are the interest coverage ratios for The College Shop:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p05">As the company’s income went down, so did its interest coverage (which isn’t good). But the real problem surfaces when you compare the firm’s interest coverage with that of its industry, which is much higher—14.5. This figure means that companies in the industry have, on average, $14.50 in operating income to cover each $1.00 of interest that it must pay. Unfortunately, The College Shop has only $3.30.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s02_s05_s02_p06">Again, consider an example on a more personal level. Let’s say that following graduation, you have a regular interest payment due on some student loans. If you get a fairly low-paying job and your income is only 3 times the amount of your interest payment, you’ll have trouble making your payments. If, on the other hand, you land a great job and your income is 15 times the amount of your interest payments, you can cover them much more comfortably.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Have the Ratios Told Us?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p01">So, what have we learned about the performance of The College Shop? What do we foresee for the company in the future? To answer this question, let’s identify some of the basic things that every businessperson needs to do in order to achieve success:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Make a good profit on each item you sell.</li>
            <li>Move inventory: the faster you sell inventory, the more money you make.</li>
            <li>Provide yourself and others with a good return on investment: make investing in your business worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Watch your cash: if you run out of cash and can’t pay your bills, you’re out of business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p02">The ratios that we’ve computed in this section allow us to evaluate The College Shop on each of these dimensions, and here’s what we found:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_l02">
            <li>Profit margin ratios (gross profit margin and net profit margin) indicate that the company makes a reasonable profit on its sales, though profitability is declining.</li>
            <li>One management efficiency ratio (inventory turnover) suggests that inventory is moving quickly, though the rate of turnover is slowing.</li>
            <li>One management effectiveness ratio (return on assets) tells us that the company generated an excellent return on its assets in its first year and a good return in its second year. But again, the trend is downward.</li>
            <li>Financial condition ratios (current ratio, total debt-to-equity, and interest coverage) paint a picture of a company heading for financial trouble. While meeting current bills is not presently a problem, the company has too much debt and isn’t earning enough money to make its interest payments comfortably. Moreover, repayment of a big loan in a few years will put a cash strain on the company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s04_s03_p03">What, then, does the future hold for The College Shop? It depends. If the company returns to year-1 levels of gross margin (when it made $0.45 on each $1.00 of sales), and if it can increase its sales volume, it might generate enough cash to reduce its long-term debt. But if the second-year decline in profitability continues, it will run into financial difficulty in the next few years. It could even be forced out of business when the bank demands payment on its long-term loan.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p01">Consider the following scenario. You feel good that you’ve managed to create <em class="emphasis">relevant, accurate, timely</em> financial statements for your first year in business as The College Shop, but you find that you’re disappointed about one thing—your net income figure. For some time now, you’ve been trying to convince a friend to invest in The College Shop, telling him that the business would bring in at least $40,000 in income during its first year. Every time you review the income statement in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch12_s03#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 12.15 "Income Statement for The College Shop, Year Ended December 31"</a> (shown in abbreviated form below), however, you’re forced to face the fact that you earned just $30,000—$10,000 short of your optimistic projection.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Revenues − Expenses (CGS, operating expenses, interest and taxes) = Net income</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$500,000 − $470,000 = $30,000</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p02">As you stare one more time at your bottom line, you’re wishing that there was some way to change that single bothersome digit and transform $30,000 into $40,000. Then it hits you. You know that it’s not exactly the most upright thing to do, but what if you were to shift half of your first-year advertising expense of $20,000 into your second year of operation? If you did that, then you’d cut the advertising expense on your first-year income statement by $10,000. Now, with your newly acquired understanding of accounting principles, you know that if you reduce expenses on your income statement by $10,000, your net income will increase by the same amount. So just to see what your “revised” income statement would look like, you go ahead and make your hypothetical change. Sure enough, mission accomplished: Your income statement now reports a net income of $40,000—your actual net income of $30,000 plus your upward “adjustment” of $10,000.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Revenues − Expenses (CGS, operating expenses, interest and taxes) = Net income</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$500,000 − $460,000 = $40,000</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p03">Although you now feel even more satisfied than ever with your newfound expertise in accounting strategy, you’re once again forced to stop and think. If you merely change your net income and nothing else, the balance sheet in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch12_s03#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s06_f01">Figure 12.17 "End-of-Year Balance Sheet for The College Shop"</a> won’t balance any more. Why not? Because when you inflated your net income to $40,000 and added it to your beginning owner’s equity balance of $150,000, this increased your owner’s equity by $10,000—from $180,000 to $190,000. To make sure that you’ve accurately assessed the snag in your strategy, you plug in the accounting equation—</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">

        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p04">—and this, unfortunately, is what you get:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">

        <p class="para editable block" id="e892.collins-ch12_s05_p05">So, now what? As you ponder the troublesome ramifications of your balance sheet, yet another accounting strategy pops into your head. At the end of the year, you still owed $6,000 for radio ads and $4,000 for newspaper ads—$10,000 that’s included in <em class="emphasis">accounts payable</em> on your year-end balance sheet. What if you just reduced your <em class="emphasis">accounts payable</em> balance by $10,000? If you did that, you’d also reduce by $10,000 the amount under <em class="emphasis">liabilities and owner’s equity</em>, cutting it from $370,000 to $360,000. Wouldn’t that make everything balance? Plugging in the numbers from your latest brainstorm, you now get:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
				<span class="mathphrase">$360,000 = $170,000 + $190,000.</span>

In 2002, when the giant telecom company WorldCom collapsed under the weight of an $11 billion fraud scheme, CEO Ebbers, who was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy, got twenty-five years in a federal penitentiary (“I don’t know accounting,” he told the judge). And Ebbers wasn’t the only person on the WorldCom payroll who was charged with illegal activities: Accounting department managers went down with him. Betty Vinson, for example, a forty-seven-year-old midlevel accountant who’d followed orders to falsify accounting records, was sentenced to five months in jail. And she was lucky—she got minimal jail time because she cooperated with federal prosecutors.<span class="footnote" id="e892.fwk-collins-fn12_009">See Susan Pulliam, “How Following Orders Can Hurt Your Career,” <em class="emphasis">CFO.com</em>, October 3, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cfo.com">http://www.cfo.com</a> (accessed July 22, 2010).</span></p>

In 2001, when Enron, the seventh-largest company in America, melted down in the heat of an investigation into its financial-reporting practices, it took down an entire accounting firm with it—eighty-nine-year-old Arthur Andersen, then one of the “Big Five” public accounting firms. Volumes have been written about what went wrong, but we can pretty much boil it down to this: <em class="emphasis">Enron executives behaved unethically and illegally, and Andersen auditors looked the other way</em>. Instead of performing its role as public watchdog, Andersen was watching its own pocketbook: The accounting firm protected the revenues generated by lucrative consulting contracts with its client instead of protecting the client’s stakeholders. In so doing, Andersen not only shirked its responsibilities as a public auditor but also covered up evidence of its own inappropriate actions.</p>

As we’ve seen, accountants are supposed to provide <em class="emphasis">users</em> with financial reports that are <em class="emphasis">useful</em> because they’re relevant, timely, and, most important, accurate. It should go without saying that if users—whether internal or external—can’t trust these reports to be accurate, they can’t rely on them to be as useful as they should be.

Another thing that you may not know is that accounting is a “people profession.” A lot of people think that accountants spend the day sitting behind desks crunching numbers, but this is a serious misconception. Accountants work with other people to solve business problems. They need strong analytical skills to assess financial data, but they must also be able to work effectively with colleagues. Thus they need good interpersonal skills, and because they must write and speak clearly and present complex financial data in terms that everyone can understand, they need excellent communication skills as well.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-115541-789201">
                <li>Work as a public accountant, whether for a “Big Four” public accounting firm or for a midsize or smaller company</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s05_s02_p02">Let’s take a closer look at these options. Public accounting firms provide clients with accounting and tax services in return for fees.

This “stamp of approval” provides the investing public with confidence that a firm’s financial reports are accurate. Typically, public accountants are self-employed, work for small, sometimes regional firms, or are associated with one of the “Big Four” public accounting firms—Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers—or one of the large second-tier public accounting firms, such as BDO Seidman or Grant Thornton.</p>

Over this same fifty-year period, Target emerged as a major player in the retail industry. The fifty-year period wasn’t kind to Kmart and Sears, and both stores watched their dominance in the retail market slip away.

To learn more about how Wal-Mart, Target, and Sears Holdings are doing today, go to the National Retail Federation’s Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.stores.org/STORES%20Magazine%20July%202011/top-100-retailers">http://www.stores.org/STORES%20Magazine%20July%202011/top-100-retailers</a>) to access a report that ranks the 2010 top 100 retailers. After reading the introduction and reviewing the list of top retailers, prepare a report comparing the three retailers on the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch12_s06_l01">
            <li>U.S. sales and percentage increase or decrease in sales</li>
            <li>Worldwide sales</li>
            <li>Number of stores and percentage increase or decrease in number of stores</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p02">Based on your analysis and reading of the introductory write-up, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch12_s06_l02">
            <li>Do you believe that Target will be able to compete against Wal-Mart in the future? If so, how?</li>
            <li>What about Sears Holdings? Will the company survive?</li>
            <li>Some people criticize Wal-Mart for forcing other retailers out of business and for lowering the average wage for retail workers. Is this a legitimate criticism? In your opinion, has Wal-Mart helped the American people or hurt them?</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p05">You recently ran into one of your former high school teachers. You were surprised to learn that he’d left teaching, gone back to school, and, a little more than a year ago, started a business that creates Web sites for small companies. It so happens that he needs a loan to expand his business, and the bank wants financial statements. When he found out that you were studying accounting, he asked whether you’d look over a set of statements that he’d just prepared for his first year in business. Because you’re anxious to show off your accounting aptitude, you agreed.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p06">First, he showed you his income statement. It looked fine: revenues (from designing Web sites) were $94,000, expenses were $86,000, and net income was $8,000. When you observed how unusual it was that he’d earned a profit in his first year, he seemed a little uneasy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p07">“Well,” he confessed, “I fudged a little when I prepared the statements. Otherwise, I’d never get the loan.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p08">He admitted that $10,000 of the fees shown on the income statement was for work he’d recently started doing for a client (who happened to be in big trouble with the IRS). “It isn’t like I won’t be earning the money,” he explained. “I’m just counting it a little early. It was easy to do. I just added $10,000 to my revenues and recorded an accounts receivable for the same amount.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p09">You quickly did the math: without the $10,000 payment for the client in question, his profit of $8,000 would become a loss of $2,000 (revenues of $84,000 less expenses of $86,000).</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p10">As your former teacher turned to get his balance sheet, you realized that, as his accountant, you had to decide what you’d advise him to do. The decision is troublesome because you agree that if he changes the income statement to reflect the real situation, he won’t get the bank loan.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch12_s06_l05">
            <li>What did you decide to do, and why?</li>
            <li>Assuming that he doesn’t change the income statement, will his balance sheet be incorrect? How about his statement of cash flows? What will happen to next year’s income: will it be higher or lower than it should be?</li>
            <li>What would happen to your former teacher if he gave the bank the fraudulent financial statements and the bank discovered the truth? How could the bank learn the truth?</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p13">You’re surprised at a few of these items. First, out of the $70, the profit made by the manufacturer was only $6.25. Second, at $2.75, labor accounted for only about 4 percent of the price you paid. The advertising cost ($4.00) was higher than the labor cost. If labor isn’t a very big factor in the cost of the shoes, why are they made in China?</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch12_s06_p14">Deciding to look further into this puzzle, you discover that the $2.75 labor cost was for two hours of work.
