    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p01">In developing BTIO and Realityworks Inc., the Jurmains were doing what entrepreneurs do (and doing it very well). In fact, Mary was nominated three times for the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and named 2001 Wisconsin Entrepreneurial Woman of the Year by the National Association of Women Business Owners. So what, exactly, is an <em class="emphasis">entrepreneur</em>? What does an entrepreneur do? According to one definition, an entrepreneur is an “individual who starts a new business,” and that’s true as far as it goes. Another definition identifies an entrepreneur as someone who uses “resources to implement innovative ideas for new, thoughtfully planned ventures,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_002">Canadian Foundation for Economic Education, “Glossary of Terms,” <em class="emphasis">Mentors, Ventures &amp; Plans</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html">http://www.mvp.cfee.org/en/glossary.html</a> (accessed October 7, 2008).</span> which is also true as far as it goes. But an important component of a satisfactory definition is still missing. To appreciate fully what it is, let’s go back to the story of the Jurmains, for whom entrepreneurship seems to have worked out quite well. We hasten to point out that, in 1993, the Jurmains were both unemployed—Rick had been laid off by General Dynamics Corp., and Mary by the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. While they were watching the show about teenagers and flour sacks, they were living off a loan from her father and the returns from a timely investment in coffee futures. Rick recalls that the idea for a method of creating BTIO came to him while “I was awake in bed, worrying about being unemployed.” He was struggling to find a way to feed his family. He had to make the first forty simulators himself, and at the end of the first summer, BTIO had received about four hundred orders—a promising start, perhaps, but, at $250 per baby (less expenses), not exactly a windfall. “We were always about one month away from bankruptcy,” recalls Mary.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_p02">At the same time, it’s not as if the Jurmains started up BTIO simply because they had no “conventional” options for improving their financial prospects. Rick, as we’ve seen, was an aerospace engineer, and his résumé includes work on space-shuttle missions at NASA. Mary, who has not only a head for business but also a degree in industrial engineering, has worked at the Johnson Space Center. Therefore, the idea of replacing a sack of flour with a computer-controlled simulator wasn’t necessarily rocket science for the couple. But taking advantage of that idea—choosing to start a new business and to commit themselves to running it—was a risk. <em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em> is the missing component that we’re looking for in a definition of <em class="emphasis">entrepreneurship</em>, and so we’ll define an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entrepreneur</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who identifies a business opportunity and assumes the risk of creating and running a business to take advantage of it.</span></span> as someone who identifies a business opportunity and assumes <em class="emphasis">the risk of creating and running a business</em> to take advantage of it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Nature of Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p01">If we look a little more closely at the definition of entrepreneurship, we can identify three characteristics of entrepreneurial activity:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_003">Adapted from Marc J. Dollinger, <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneurship</em>: <em class="emphasis">Strategies and Resources</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003), 5–7.</span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Innovation</em>. Entrepreneurship generally means offering a new product, applying a new technique or technology, opening a new market, or developing a new form of organization for the purpose of producing or enhancing a product.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Running a business</em>. A <em class="emphasis">business</em>, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>, combines resources to produce goods or services. Entrepreneurship means setting up a business to make a profit.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Risk taking</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">risk</em> means that the outcome of the entrepreneurial venture can’t be known. Entrepreneurs, therefore, are always working under a certain degree of <em class="emphasis">uncertainty</em>, and they can’t know the outcomes of many of the decisions that they have to make. Consequently, many of the steps they take are motivated mainly by their confidence in the innovation and in their understanding of the business environment in which they’re operating.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s01_p02">It isn’t hard to recognize all three of these characteristics in the entrepreneurial experience of the Jurmains. They certainly had an <em class="emphasis">innovative</em> idea. But was it a <em class="emphasis">good</em> business idea? In a practical sense, a “good” business idea has to become something more than just an idea. If, like the Jurmains, you’re interested in generating income from your idea, you’ll probably need to turn it into a <em class="emphasis">product</em>—something that you can market because it satisfies a need. If—again, like the Jurmains—you want to develop a product, you’ll need some kind of organization to coordinate the resources necessary to make it a reality (in other words, a <em class="emphasis">business</em>). Risk enters the equation when, like the Jurmains, you make the decision to start up a business and when you commit yourself to managing it.</p>

But when her financial aid was delayed, she abandoned her plans to attend college and took a job as a personal trainer (a natural occupation for a former bodybuilder and middleweight title holder). But things got boring in the summer when her wealthy clients left the city for the Hamptons. To keep busy, she took a skin care course at a Manhattan cosmetology institute. As a teenager, she was self-conscious about her bad complexion and wanted to know how to treat it herself. She learned how to give facials and work with natural remedies. Her complexion improved, and she started giving facials to her fitness clients who were thrilled with the results. As demand for her services exploded, she started her first business—Bliss Spa—and picked up celebrity clients, including Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, and Jennifer Lopez. The business went international, and she sold it for more than $30 million.<span class="footnote" id="e995.fwk-collins-fn05_052">Jessica Bruder, “The Rise Of The Serial Entrepreneur,” <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, August 12, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/12/serial-entrepreneur-start-up-business-forbes-woman-entrepreneurs-management_3.html">http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/12/serial-entrepreneur-start-up-business-forbes-woman-entrepreneurs-management _3.html</a> (accessed August 29, 2011).</span></p>

Instead, she launched two more companies: Soap and Glory, a supplier of affordable beauty products sold at Target, and FitFlops, which sells sandals that tone and tighten your leg muscles as you walk. And by the way, remember how Oprah loved Kilgore’s skin care products? She also loves Kilgore’s sandals and plugged them on her talk show. You can’t get a better endorsement than that. Kilgore never did finish college, but when asked if she would follow the same path again, she said, “If I had to decide what to do all over again, I would make the same choices…I found by accident what I'm good at, and I'm glad I did.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">Let’s say that you are interested in the idea of going into business for yourself. Not everyone, of course, has a desire to take the risks and put in the work involved in starting up a business. What sort of characteristics distinguishes those who do from those who don’t want to start a business? Or, more to the point, why do some people actually follow through on the desire to start up their own businesses? According to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Small Business Administration (SBA)</a><span class="glossdef">Government agency that helps prospective owners set up small businesses, obtain financing, and manage ongoing operations.</span></span>, a government agency that provides assistance to small businesses, the most common reasons for starting a business are the following:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_007">U.S. Small Business Administration, “First Steps: How to Start a Small Business,” <a class="link" href="http://www.sba.gov/starting/indexsteps.html">http://www.sba.gov/starting/indexsteps.html</a> (accessed April 21, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p02">The Small Business Administration points out, though, that these are likely to be advantages only “for the right person.” And how do you know if you’re one of the “right people”? The SBA suggests that you assess your strengths and weaknesses by asking yourself a few relevant questions:<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-102014-361827">U.S. Small Business Administration, “Is Entrepreneurship for You?” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/content/entrepreneurship-you">http://www.sba.gov/content/entrepreneurship-you</a> (accessed August 31, 2011).</span></p>

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Am I a self-starter</em>? You’ll need to develop and follow through on your ideas. You’ll need to be able to organize your time.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">How well do I get along with different personalities</em>? You’ll need to develop working relationships with a variety of people, including unreliable vendors and sometimes cranky customers.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">How good am I at making decisions</em>? You’ll be making decisions constantly—often under pressure.</li>
                <li>

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">How well do I plan and organize</em>? If you can’t stay organized, you’ll get swamped by the details. In fact, poor planning is the culprit in most business failures.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Is my drive strong enough</em>? You’ll need to be highly motivated to withstand bad periods in your business, and simply being responsible for your business’s success can cause you to burn out.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">Though most entrepreneurial ventures begin as small businesses, not all small business owners are entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are innovators who start companies to create new or improved products. They strive to meet a need that’s not being met, and their goal is to grow the business and eventually expand into other markets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="e996.collins-5300-20111110-102236-290789">In contrast, many people either start or buy small businesses for the sole purpose of providing an income for themselves and their families. They do not intend to be particularly innovative, nor do they plan to expand significantly. This desire to operate is what’s sometimes called a “lifestyle business.”<span class="footnote" id="e996.fwk-collins-fn05_053">Kathleen Allen, <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneurship for Dummies</em> (New York: Wiley, 2001), 14.</span> The neighborhood pizza parlor or beauty shop, the self-employed consultant who works out of the home, and even a local printing company—all of these are typical lifestyle businesses.

                    <li>Though most entrepreneurial ventures begin as small businesses, not all small business owners are entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are innovators who start companies to create new or improved products. In contrast, many people start businesses for the purpose of providing an income for themselves and their families. This type of businesses is sometimes called a “lifestyle business.”</li>
