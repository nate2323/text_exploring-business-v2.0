    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_p01">We hope that, so far, we’ve made at least one thing clear: If you’re in business, you need to understand financial statements. For one thing, the law no longer allows high-ranking executives to plead ignorance or fall back on delegation of authority when it comes to taking responsibility for a firm’s financial reporting. In a business environment tainted by episodes of fraudulent financial reporting and other corporate misdeeds, top managers are now being held accountable (so to speak) for the financial statements issued by the people who report to them. For another thing, top managers need to know if the company is hitting on all cylinders or sputtering down the road to bankruptcy. To put it another way (and to switch metaphors): if he didn’t understand the financial statements issued by the company’s accountants, an executive would be like an airplane pilot who doesn’t know how to read the instrument in the cockpit—he might be able keep the plane in the air for a while, but he wouldn’t recognize any signs of impending trouble until it was too late.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Function of Financial Statements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Put yourself in the place of the woman in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s01_f10">Figure 12.4 "What Connie Wants to Know"</a>. She runs Connie’s Confections out of her home. She loves what she does, and she feels that she’s doing pretty well. In fact, she has an opportunity to take over a nearby store at very reasonable rent, and she can expand by getting a modest bank loan and investing some more of her own money. So it’s decision time for Connie: She knows that the survival rate for start-ups isn’t very good, and before taking the next step, she’d like to get a better idea of whether she’s actually doing well enough to justify the risk. As you can see, she has several pertinent questions. We aren’t privy to Connie’s finances, but we can tell her how basic financial statements will give her some answers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn12_008">We’ll discuss the <em class="emphasis">statement of cash flows</em> later in the chapter.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Toying with a Business Idea</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p01">We know what you’re thinking: It’s nice to know that accounting deals with real-life situations, but while you wish Connie the best, you don’t know enough about the confectionary business to appreciate either the business decisions or the financial details. Is there any way to bring this lesson a little closer to home? Besides, while knowing what financial statements will tell you is one thing, you want to know how to <em class="emphasis">prepare</em> them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p02">Agreed. So let’s assume that you need to earn money while you’re in college and that you’ve decided to start a small business. Your business will involve selling stuff to other college students, and to keep things simple, we’ll assume that you’re going to operate on a “cash” basis: you’ll pay for everything with cash, and everyone who buys something from you will pay in cash.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">A Word about Cash.</em> You probably have at least a little <em class="emphasis">cash</em> on you right now—some currency, or paper money, and coins. In accounting, however, the term <em class="emphasis">cash</em> refers to more than just paper money and coins. It also refers to the money that you have in checking and savings accounts and includes items that you can deposit in these accounts, such as money orders and different types of checks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-075826-558960">Your first task is to decide exactly what you’re going to sell. You’ve noticed that with homework, exams, social commitments, and the hectic lifestyle of the average college student, you and most of the people you know always seem to be under a lot of stress. Sometimes you wish you could just lie back between meals and bounce a ball off the wall. And that’s when the idea hits you: Maybe you could make some money by selling a product called the “Stress-Buster Play Pack.” Here’s what you have in mind: you’ll buy small toys and other fun stuff—instant stress relievers—at a local dollar store and pack them in a rainbow-colored plastic treasure chest labeled “Stress-Buster.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-075902-566207">And here’s where you stand: You have enough cash to buy a month’s worth of plastic treasure chests and toys. After that, you’ll use the cash generated from sales of Stress-Buster Play Packs to replenish your supply. Each plastic chest will cost $1.00, and you’ll fill each one with a variety of five of the following toys, all of which you can buy for $1.00 each:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-080037-761756">
                <li>A happy face stress ball</li>
                <li>A roomarang (an indoor boomerang)</li>
                <li>Some silly putty</li>
                <li>An inflatable beach ball</li>
                <li>A coil “slinky” spring</li>
                <li>A paddle-ball game</li>
                <li>A ball for bouncing off walls</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">You plan to sell each Stress-Buster Play Pack for $10 from a rented table stationed outside a major dining hall. Renting the table will cost you $20 a month. Because your own grades aren’t what your parents and the dean would like them to be, you decide to hire fellow students (trustworthy people with better grades than yours) to staff the table at peak traffic periods. They’ll be on duty from noon until 2:00 p.m. each weekday, and you’ll pay them $6 an hour. Wages, therefore, will cost you $240 a month (2 hours × 5 days × 4 weeks = 40 hours × $6). Finally, you’ll run ads in the college newspaper at a monthly cost of $40. Thus your total monthly costs will amount to $300 ($20 + $240 + $40).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Let’s say that during your first month, you sell one hundred play packs.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-081104-732105">Now you need to do a little subtracting:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-081819-852034">

            <li>The positive difference between <em class="emphasis">gross profit</em> and <em class="emphasis">operating expenses</em> is your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">net income</a><span class="glossdef">Positive difference between gross profit and total expenses.</span></span> or <strong class="emphasis bold">profit</strong>, which is the proverbial “bottom line.” (If this difference is <em class="emphasis">negative</em>, you took a <em class="emphasis">loss</em> instead of making a profit.)</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What If You Want to Make More Money?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold"></strong>You’re quite relieved to see that you made a profit during your first month, but you can’t help but wonder what you’ll have to do to make even more money next month. You consider three possibilities:</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Reduce your cost of goods sold (say, package four toys instead of five)</li>
            <li>Reduce your operating costs (salaries, advertising, table rental)</li>
            <li>Increase the quantity of units sold</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p05">In order to consider these possibilities fully, you need to generate new income statements for each option. And to do that, you’ll have to play a few “what-if” games. Because possibility #1—packaging four toys instead of five—is the most appealing, you start there. Your cost of goods sold would go down from $6 to $5 per unit (4 toys at $1 each + 1 plastic treasure chest at $1). <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s02_f02">Figure 12.6 "Proposed Income Statement Number One for Stress-Buster Company"</a> is your hypothetical income statement if you choose this option.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_f02">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 12.6</span> Proposed Income Statement Number One for Stress-Buster Company</p>
            <img src="section_16/f0512f21741e847e3be2eca2bc06f532.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p06">Possibility #1 seems to be a good idea. Under this scenario, your income doubles from $100 to $200 because your per-unit <em class="emphasis">gross profit</em> increases by $1 (and you sold 100 stress packs). But there may be a catch: If you cut back on the number of toys, your customers might perceive your product as a lesser value for the money. In fact, you’re reminded of a conversation that you once had with a friend whose father, a restaurant owner, had cut back on the cost of the food he served by buying less expensive meat. In the short term, gross profit per meal went up, but customers eventually stopped coming back and the restaurant nearly went out of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p07">Thus you decide to consider possibility #2—reducing your operating costs. In theory, it’s a good idea, but in practice—at least in your case—it probably won’t work. Why not? For one thing, you can’t do without the table and you need your workers (because your grades haven’t improved, you still don’t have time to sit at the table yourself). Second, if you cut salaries from, say, $6 to $5 an hour, you may have a hard time finding people willing to work for you. Finally, you could reduce advertising costs by running an ad every two weeks instead of every week, but this tactic would increase your income by only $20 a month and could easily lead to a drop in sales.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p08">Now you move on to possibility #3—increase sales. The appealing thing about this option is that it has no downside. If you could somehow increase the number of units sold from 100 Stress-Buster packs per month to 150, your income would go up, even if you stick with your original five-toy product. So you decide to crunch some numbers for possibility #3 and come up with the new “what-if” income statement in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s02_f03">Figure 12.7 "Proposed Income Statement Number Two for Stress-Buster Company"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_p09">As you can see, this is an attractive possibility, even though you haven’t figured out how you’re going to increase sales (maybe you could put up some eye-popping posters and play cool music to attract people to your table.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p01">Playing these what-if games has started you thinking: is there some way to figure out the level of sales you need to avoid <em class="emphasis">losing</em> money—to “break even”? This can be done using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">breakeven analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Method of determining the level of sales at which the company will break even (have no profit or loss).</span></span>.

To determine the level of sales at which this will occur, you need to do the following:</p>

If you want to make a profit of $200—which is $200 <em class="emphasis">above your breakeven point</em>—you must sell an additional 50 units ($200 desired profit divided by $4 contribution margin per unit) above your breakeven point of 75 units.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_p02">Whereas your income statement tells you how much income you earned <em class="emphasis">over some period of time</em>, your balance sheet tells you what you have (and where it came from) <em class="emphasis">at a specific point in time</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_p03">Most companies prepare financial statements on a twelve-month basis—that is, for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fiscal year</a><span class="glossdef">Company’s designated business year.</span></span> which ends on December 31 or some other logical date, such as June 30 or September 30. Why do fiscal years vary? A company generally picks a fiscal-year end date that coincides with the end of its peak selling period; thus a crabmeat processor might end its fiscal year in October, when the crab supply has dwindled. Most companies also produce financial statements on a quarterly or monthly basis. For Stress-Buster, you’ll want to prepare a monthly balance sheet.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Accounting Equation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p01">The balance sheet is based on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounting equation</a><span class="glossdef">Accounting tool showing the resources of a business (assets) and the claims on those resources (liabilities and owner’s equity).</span></span>:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block">
									<span class="mathphrase">assets = liabilities + owner’s equity</span>
				</span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p02">This important equation highlights the fact that a company’s <em class="emphasis">assets</em> came from somewhere: either from loans (<em class="emphasis">liabilities</em>) or from investments made by the owners (<em class="emphasis">owner’s equity</em>). This means that the asset section of the balance sheet on the one hand and the liability and owner’s-equity section on the other must be equal, or <em class="emphasis">balance</em>. Thus the term <em class="emphasis">balance sheet</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p03">Let’s prepare two balance sheets for your company: one for the first day you started and one for the end of your first month of business. We’ll assume that when you started Stress-Buster, you borrowed $400 from your parents and put in $200 of your own money. If you look at your first balance sheet in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_f01">Figure 12.9 "Balance Sheet Number One for Stress-Buster Company"</a> you’ll see that your business has $600 in cash (your <em class="emphasis">assets</em>): Of this total, you borrowed $400 (your <em class="emphasis">liabilities</em>) and invested $200 of your own money (your <em class="emphasis">owner’s equity</em>). So far, so good: Your assets section <em class="emphasis">balances</em> with your liabilities and owner’s equity section.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p04">Now let’s see how things have changed by the end of the month. Recall that Stress-Buster earned $100 (based on sales of 100 units) during the month of September and that you decided to leave these earnings in the business. This $100 profit increases two items on your <em class="emphasis">balance sheet</em>: the <em class="emphasis">assets</em> of the company (its cash) and your investment in it (its <em class="emphasis">owner’s equity</em>). <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s02_s03_s01_f02">Figure 12.10 "Balance Sheet Number Two for Stress-Buster Company"</a> shows what your balance sheet will look like on September 30. Once again, it <em class="emphasis">balances</em>. You now have $700 in cash: $400 that you borrowed plus $300 that you’ve invested in the business (your original $200 investment plus the $100 profit from the first month of operations, which you’ve kept in the business).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111123-092430-126227">Why must they be prepared in this order?
