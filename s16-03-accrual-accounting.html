    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_p01">In this section, we’re going to take a step further into the world of accounting by examining the principles of <em class="emphasis">accrual accounting</em>. In our Stress-Buster illustration, we’ve assumed that all your transactions have been made in <em class="emphasis">cash</em>: You paid cash for your inputs (plastic treasure chests and toys) and for your other expenses, and your customers paid cash when they bought Stress-Buster packs. In the real world, of course, things are rarely that simple. In the following cases, timing plays a role in making and receiving payments:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_l02">
        <li>Customers don’t always pay in cash; they often buy something and pay later. When this happens, the seller is owed money and has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">account receivable</a><span class="glossdef">Record of cash that will be received from a customer to whom a business has sold products on credit.</span></span> (it will <em class="emphasis">receive</em> something later).</li>
        <li>Companies don’t generally pay cash for materials and other expenses—they often pay later. If this is the case, the buyer has an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">account payable</a><span class="glossdef">Record of cash owed to sellers from whom a business has purchased products on credit.</span></span> (it will <em class="emphasis">pay</em> something later).</li>
        <li>Many companies manufacture or buy goods and hold them in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inventory</a><span class="glossdef">Goods that a business has made or bought and expects to sell in the process of normal operations.</span></span> before selling them. Under these circumstances, they don’t report payment for the goods until they’ve been sold.</li>
        <li>Companies buy <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em> (also called <em class="emphasis">fixed assets</em>), such as cars, buildings, and equipment, which they plan to use over an extended period (as a rule, for more than one year).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch12_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Accrual Accounting?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_p02">In situations such as these, firms use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accrual accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Accounting system that records transactions when they occur, regardless of when cash is paid or received.</span></span>: a system in which the accountant records a transaction <em class="emphasis">when it occurs</em>, without waiting until cash is paid out or received. Here are a few basic principles of accrual accounting:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_l04">
            <li>A sale is recognized on the income statement <em class="emphasis">when it takes place</em>, regardless of when cash is collected.</li>
            <li>An expense is recognized on the income statement <em class="emphasis">when it’s incurred</em>, regardless of when payment is made.</li>
            <li>An item manufactured for later sale or bought for resale becomes part of <em class="emphasis">inventory</em> and appears on the balance sheet <em class="emphasis">until it’s actually sold</em>; at that point, it goes on the income statement under <em class="emphasis">cost of goods sold</em>.</li>
            <li>A <em class="emphasis">long-term asset</em> that will be used for several years—for example, a vehicle, machine, or building—appears on the balance sheet. Its cost is spread <em class="emphasis">over its useful life</em>—the number of years that it will be used. Its annual allocated cost appears on the income statement as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">depreciation expense</a><span class="glossdef">Costs of a long-term or fixed asset spread over its useful life.</span></span>.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Going to School on a New Business Idea</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_p03">As we saw in our Stress-Buster illustration, it’s easier to make sense of accounting concepts when you see some real—or at least realistic—numbers being put to realistic use. So let’s now assume that you successfully operated the Stress-Buster Company while you were in college. Now fast-forward to graduation, and rather than work for someone else, you’ve decided to set up a more ambitious business—some kind of retail outlet—close to the college. During your four years in school, you noticed that there was no store near campus that met the wide range of students’ specific needs. Thus the mission of your proposed retail business: to provide products that satisfy the specific needs of college students.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_p04">You’ve decided to call your store “The College Shop.” Your product line will range from things needed to outfit a dorm room (linens, towels, small appliances, desks, rugs, dorm refrigerators) to things that are just plain fun and make student life more enjoyable (gift packages, posters, lava lamps, games, inflatable furniture, bean bag chairs, message boards, shower radios, backpacks). And of course you’ll also sell the original Stress-Buster Fun Pack. You’ll advertise to students and parents through the college newspaper and your own Web site.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Accrual-Basis Financial Statements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_p01">At this point, we’re going to repeat pretty much the same process that we went through with your first business. First, we’ll prepare a <em class="emphasis">beginning balance sheet</em> that reflects your new company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity on your first day of business—January 1, 20X6. Next, we’ll prepare an <em class="emphasis">income statement</em> and a <em class="emphasis">statement of owner’s equity</em>. Finally, we’ll create a balance sheet that reflects the company’s financial state at the end of your first year of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_p02">Although the process should now be familiar, the details of our new statements will be more complex—after all, your transactions will be more complicated: You’re going to sell and buy stuff on credit, maintain an inventory of goods to be sold, retain assets for use over an extended period of time, borrow money and pay interest on it, and deal with a variety of expenses that you didn’t have before (rent, insurance, etc.).</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Beginning Balance Sheet</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s01_p01">Your new beginning balance sheet contains the same items as the one that you created for Stress-Buster—cash, loans, and owner’s equity. But because you’ve already performed a broader range of transactions before you opened for business, you’ll need some new categories:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>You’ve bought furniture and equipment that you’ll use over the next five years. You’ll allocate the cost of these long-term assets by depreciating them. Because you estimate that this furniture and equipment will have a <em class="emphasis">useful life</em> of five years, you allocate one-fifth of the cost per year for five years.</li>
                <li>You’ve purchased an inventory of goods for later resale.</li>
                <li>You’ve taken out two types of loans: one that’s <em class="emphasis">current</em> because it’s payable in one year and one that’s <em class="emphasis">long term</em> because it’s due in five years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s01_p02">Obviously, then, you need to prepare a more sophisticated balance sheet than the one you created for your first business. We call this new kind of balance sheet a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">classified balance sheet</a><span class="glossdef">Balance sheet that totals assets and liabilities in separate categories.</span></span> because it classifies assets and liabilities into separate categories.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Assets</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s02_p01">On a classified balance sheet, assets are listed in order of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">liquidity</a><span class="glossdef">Speed with which an asset can be converted into cash.</span></span>—how quickly they can be converted into cash. They’re also broken down into two categories:</p>

<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Long-term assets</a><span class="glossdef">Asset that a business intends to hold for more than a year before converting it to cash.</span></span>—assets that you intend to hold for more than a year</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s02_p02">Your current assets will be cash and inventory, and your long-term assets will be furniture and equipment. We’ll take a closer look at the assets section of your beginning balance sheet, but it makes sense to analyze your liabilities first.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s03_p01">Liabilities are grouped in much the same manner as assets:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s03_l01">

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s03_p02">Recall that your liabilities come from your two loans: one which is payable in a year and considered current, and one which is long term and due in five years.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s03_p03">Now we’re ready to review your beginning balance sheet, which is shown in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 12.14 "Beginning Balance Sheet for The College Shop"</a>. Once again, your balance sheet balances: Your total assets of $275,000 equal your total liabilities plus owner’s equity of $275,000.</p>

                    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s08_p01">Let’s begin our analysis of your beginning balance sheet with the liabilities and owner’s-equity sections. We’re assuming that, thanks to a strong business plan, you’ve convinced a local bank to loan you a total of $125,000—a short-term loan of $25,000 and a long-term loan of $100,000. Naturally, the bank charges you <em class="emphasis">interest</em> (which is the cost of borrowing money); your rate is 8 percent per year. In addition, you personally contributed $150,000 to the business (thanks to a trust fund that paid off when you turned 21).</p>

                    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s09_p01">Now let’s turn to the assets section of your beginning balance sheet. What do you have to show for your $275,000 in liabilities and owner’s equity? Of this amount, $50,000 is in <em class="emphasis">cash</em>—that is, money deposited in the company’s checking and other bank accounts. You used another $75,000 to pay for <em class="emphasis">inventory</em> that you’ll sell throughout the year. Finally, you spent $150,000 on several <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em>, including a sign for the store, furniture, store displays, and computer equipment. You expect to use these assets for five years, at which point you’ll probably replace them.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_p01">Finally, let’s look at your income statement, which is shown in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 12.15 "Income Statement for The College Shop, Year Ended December 31"</a>. Like your College Shop balance sheet, your College Shop income statement is more complex than the one you prepared for Stress-Buster, and the amounts are much larger. In addition, the statement covers a full calendar year.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_p02">Note, by the way, that the income statement that we prepared for The College Shop is designed for a <em class="emphasis">merchandiser</em>—a company that makes a profit by selling goods. How can you tell? Businesses that sell services (such as accounting firms or airlines) rather than merchandise don’t have lines labeled <em class="emphasis">cost of goods sold</em> on their statements.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch12_s03_s01_s04_p03">The format of this income statement also highlights the most important financial fact in running a merchandising company: <em class="emphasis">you must sell goods at a profit (called</em> gross profit<em class="emphasis">) that is high enough to cover your operating costs, interest, and taxes</em>. Your income statement, for example, shows that The College Shop generated $225,000 in <em class="emphasis">gross profit</em> through <em class="emphasis">sales</em> of goods. This amount is sufficient to cover your <em class="emphasis">operating expense</em>, interest, and taxes and still produce a <em class="emphasis">net income</em> of $30,000.</p>

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Depreciation expense</em>. Recall that before opening for business, you purchased some long-term assets (store sign, displays, furniture, and equipment) for a total amount of $150,000. In estimating that you would use these assets for five years (your estimate of their useful lives), you spread the cost of $150,000 over five years. For each of these five years, then, your income statement will show $30,000 in <em class="emphasis">depreciation</em><em class="emphasis"> expense</em> ($150,000 ÷ 5 years = $30,000).</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Interest expense</em>. When you borrowed money from the bank, you agreed to pay interest at an annual rate of 8 percent. Your <em class="emphasis">interest</em><em class="emphasis"> expense</em> of $10,000 ($125,000 × 0.08) is a cost of financing your business and appears on your income statement after the subheading <em class="emphasis">operating income</em>.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Income taxes</em>. Your company has to pay income taxes at a rate of 25 percent of <em class="emphasis">net income before taxes</em>. This amount of $10,000 ($40,000 × 25%) appears on your income statement after the subheading <em class="emphasis">net income before income taxes</em>.

You also have an <em class="emphasis">accounts receivable</em> of $90,000 because many of your customers have bought goods on credit and will pay later. In addition, the balance sheet now shows two numbers for <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em>: the original cost of these assets, $150,000, and an <em class="emphasis">accumulated depreciation</em> amount of $30,000, which reflects the amount that you’ve charged as depreciation expense since the purchase of the assets. The carrying value of these long-term assets is now $120,000 ($150,000 - $30,000), which is the difference between their original cost and the amount that they’ve been depreciated.

The income statement reports earned income on an accrual basis (recognizing revenues when earned and expenses as incurred regardless of when cash is received or paid). But the key to surviving in business is generating the <em class="emphasis">cash</em> you need to keep it up and running. It’s not unusual to hear reports about companies with cash problems. Sometimes they arise because the products in which the firm has invested aren’t selling as well as it had forecast. Maybe the company tied up too much money in a plant that’s too big for its operations. Maybe it sold products to customers who can’t pay. Maybe management just overspent. Whatever the reason, cash problems will hamper any business. Owners and other interested parties need a financial statement that helps them understand a company’s cash flow.</p>

You generated $45,000 in cash from your company’s operations (a cash inflow) and used $25,000 of this amount to pay off your short-term loan (a cash outflow). The net result was an increase in cash of $20,000. This $20,000 increase in cash agrees with the change in your cash during the year as it’s reported in your balance sheets: You had an end-of-the-year cash balance of $70,000 and a beginning-of-the-year balance of $50,000 ($70,000 − $50,000 = $20,000). Because you didn’t buy or sell any <em class="emphasis">long-term assets</em> during the year, your cash flow statement shows no cash flows from investing activities.</p>

Before heading to college at the end of August, you wanted to find out how much money you earned for the summer. Fortunately, you kept good accounting records. During the summer, you charged customers a total of $5,000 for cutting lawns (which includes $500 still owed to you by one of your biggest customers). You paid out $1,000 for gasoline, lawn mower repairs, and other expenses, including $100 for a lawn mower tune-up that you haven’t paid for yet. You decided to prepare an income statement to see how you did. Because you couldn’t decide whether you should prepare a cash-basis statement or an accrual statement, you prepared both. What was your income under each approach? Which method (cash-basis or accrual) more accurately reflects the income that you earned during the summer? Why?</p>
